# experience

## Scale AI • Generative AI Intern • January 2025 - present
- Contribute to training and evals for SOTA reasoning and agentic models across 5+ clients and 100+ tasks, ranging
from abstract visual reasoning, to deep research studies, to next-gen SWE agents solving real world GitHub issues.
- Execute rigorous quality assurance reviews for critical datasets powering SWE agents in Java, C++, Python, Go,
and Rust, evaluating intern deliverables against customer specs to ensure data integrity. Improve data quality
rating by organizing and leading in-person project workshops for contributing interns.
- Construct robust Docker testing environments and write comprehensive rubrics for industry standard AI
benchmarks such as the Aider LLM Leaderboards.

# projects

## Kaggle S&P500 Prediction • ACM AI • October 2025 - Present
- Design and iterate neural networks, such as decision trees, feed-forward networks, and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTMs) models to predict forward returns of S&P 500 for Kaggle competition.
- Improve data preprocessing and model evaluation by implementing KNN imputation for dataset NaN values and
k-fold cross validation. Competition scoring in progress.

## R1 Reasoning • ACM AI • March 2025 - June 2025
- Implemented reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) system using Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model for mathematical reasoning tasks. Improved
out-of-the-box model accuracy on test data by 17 percentage points.
- Identified and debugged issues with repetition rewards, correctness metric, and dataset parameters. Implemented
custom correctness checking via regex pattern matching and repetition detection using n-gram analysis.
- Optimized memory usage through gradient checkpointing, 8-bit optimizers, and automatic GPU memory
management for multi-GPU training.
